# 🔁 Skill Swap Platform

## 🧠 Overview

Skill Swap Platform is a web application that enables users to exchange skills with others in a collaborative and safe environment. Users can list the skills they offer and want to learn, manage their availability, and connect with others for skill-based collaborations.

This project was originally built as part of a hackathon to explore solutions for **peer-to-peer learning** without monetary constraints. It simulates a real-world system with user authentication, skill matching, and admin moderation.
